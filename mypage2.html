    “	
    I struggled for a long time with survivin', and no matter what, you keep finding something to fight for.
    ―Joel
    ”</p>
<p>A brutal survivor with few moral lines left to cross. Joel, now in his late 40s, has been hardened by the ravages of the fungal pandemic that has devastated civilization as we know it. He’s lost friends, family, and everything he valued in life. Living in one of few remaining military-controlled quarantine zones, he operates as a black market smuggler, dealing in contraband, taking numerous de-humanizing jobs over the years to survive in this new post-pandemic world. Joel’s conscience slowly dwindles away as he shuts down his emotions to cope to his new life. </p>

<p>“	
    After all we've been through... Everything that I've done, it can't be for nothing.
    ―Ellie
    ”</p>
<p>A brave, 14 year old girl, Ellie has grown up in this harsh world and it is all she has ever known. She’s an orphan who was raised in a boarding school run by the military within the bounds of the quarantine zone. Naïve and curious about the outside world, she is wise beyond her years and highly capable of taking care of herself and those around her. Obsessed with comic books, CDs, and other pop culture, her knowledge base is filled by the remnants of a world that no longer exists. But that all changed very fast in the last of us 2 well awaited sequal when a tragic loss set not so young Ellie out on a violent revenge mission.</p>

<p>“	
    You're my people.
    ―Abby
    ”</p>
<p>Abby is the daughter of Jerry Anderson, the head surgeon who worked for the Fireflies and was killed by Joel Miller when rescuing Ellie. Her father raised her as a member of the Fireflies during the apocalypse and took her to live in Salt Lake City where he worked on making a vaccine for the Cordyceps brain infection. Abby did not appear until the second game where that tragic event of losing her father set her out on a mission to kill her fathers murder. The game allows us to play as Abby showing us her side of the story! Although she may seem like the bad character, seeings things from her scope my change your mind about her.
